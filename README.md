***REMEMBER: Set action mailer URL in production environment with actual host***

Also, look at custom rake tasks! There's a railscast. #66 I believe.

Should we use a SQL DB now?
If not, it's gonna be hard to do this in rails...
But if we use a NoSQL DB, using another framework will be harder to implement and take more time.
