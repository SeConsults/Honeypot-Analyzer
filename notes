Configure and use mod_wsgi if it's needed.

Don't forget to re-enable the httpd.conf file at /etc/apache2 and 
fill in the correct paths to python and the app directory.


The problem is I just don't want to spend time dealing with it at the moment.


Basically, we want a couple of things for efficiency, if it comes to this:

mod_wsgi caches python code, making it faster. Configuration kind of sucks, though.
Its "Daemon Mode" would let us serve on multiple processes and threads, too. We might
be able to use that to our advantage.

We also would want a separate light web server to serve media (maybe?). On second thought,
we may not need this at all since we're only serving light JS and HTML.
